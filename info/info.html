				<h3>About this application</h3>
				<p>You can use this webapp to plan your trip through London on one of the Santandar Bicycles available for hire on various locations in the city. 
				Start and end locations are suggested, but you can also use the browsers geolocation feature, if available.
				We'll look for the closest station near you, measured in walking distance. 
				We take into account how many persons you want to travel with - we only select stations which have enough bikes for rent at the start and enough empty slots at the end.
				When we have calculated your optimal route, we provide you a map as well as textual directions to get from your start point to your end point. Note that the complete application is <strong>mobile friendly</strong>!
				</p>
				<h3>Used technologies</h3>
				<p>
				    The main technology used is <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJs</a>, for all application logic. There is a small proxy written in PHP to fetch the feed (~10 lines).
				    <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a> is used as the HTML5 responsive boilerplate, since it is beautifully light and easy to use.
				    A special thanks to <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> for the beautiful icons,
				    Gregory Pike for the <a href="https://github.com/grevory/angular-local-storage" target="_blank">Angular Local Storage</a> module, which is used for storing the station feed on the client side to improve performance,
				    the creators of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/x2js/" target="_blank">X2JS</a>, the library which parses the XML station feed into usable JSON data,
				    and Google for their useful API's, <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/javascript/">Google Places</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix/">Google Maps Distance Matrix</a>
				    and <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference#DirectionsService" target="_blank">Google Maps Directions Service</a>. 
				    Last but not least, a thanks to Transport for London, for supplying the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/our-feeds" target="_blank">Santandar Cycles Station Feed</a>.
